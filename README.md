# HTML-Progress
Welcome to my HTML learning repository! This space documents my exploration and growth in HTML, the fundamental language of web development.
<h3>Introduction</h3>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the backbone of every webpage on the internet. It defines the structure and content of web pages using a markup system of tags and attributes. Learning HTML is essential for anyone interested in creating websites or understanding how web content is structured.
<h3>Learning Path</h3>
<p>My learning path in HTML includes several key areas:<br>
•	   Understanding Basic Tags and Elements: Learning about essential tags like
html tag, head tag, body tag, div tag, p tag, a tag and more.<br>
•	   Creating Forms, Tables, and Lists: Exploring how to design and implement forms for user input, tables for organizing data, and lists for displaying information.<br>
•	   Integrating Multimedia: Incorporating images, videos, and audio into web pages using HTML tags like img tag, video tag, audio tag, and understanding their attributes.<br>
•	   HTML5 and Semantic Markup: Embracing modern web standards with HTML5 features such as header tag, nav tag, section tag, article tag, footer tag, and using semantic markup to enhance accessibility and SEO.<br>
•	   Accessibility Best Practices: Ensuring web content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by applying accessible HTML practices and understanding ARIA roles and attributes.</p>
